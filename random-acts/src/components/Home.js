                        <p className='picPara1'>We are all on some level, whether we realize it or not, spiritual beings.  At the highest stage of spiritual seeking we attain the state of Samadhi, Nirvana, or Enlightenment.  In Enlightenment the awareness resides at the center of the spiral of life, which lies at the center of the universe, which is actually everywhere and everything all at once and now.  The soul experiences its truth which is eternal bliss, forever uninterrupted by the illusions of the material world, i.e. suffering and worldly happiness.  We at Serve Your World believe that everyone deserves to realize this state which is the birthright of every soul.   </p>

                    <div className='flex1'>
                        <p className='picPara1'>For one to attain this state, the ego and the false sense of self has to be completely obliterated.  One must first realize his or her oneness with all things.   The first step in to this way of being, and coincidentally the first reaction to realization of these teachings, is to always think, “How can I best serve you?”</p>
